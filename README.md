## About
Hi, I'm Brian. I'm currently located in Portland, Maine working for a medium-sized FinTech company writing predominantly Python with a few flavors of Javascript sprinkled on top. My past work has included languages such as C++ and Java, and I tend to be a more of a backend focused developer. For a complete list of experiences, please see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-m-roach/) or [resum√©](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E80b9AIgrQ5zGy6z5raWs8y3LsLtXmxf/view?usp=sharing). To see some code I've written, there's also my [GitHub](https://github.com/bmroach) (admittedly it's been a little while since I've had the opportunity to work on open source projects, but there's a few neat things on there). I'm currently exploring the software consulting space on top of my regular engineering position, but I'm always open to connecting about new opportunities and projects.
