### Brian Roach


## About
Hi, I'm Brian. I'm located in Portland, Maine working for a FinTech company writing predominantly Python with a few flavors of Javascript sprinkled on top. My past work has included languages such as C++ and Java, and I tend to be a more of a backend focused developer. For a complete list of experiences, please see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-m-roach/). To see some code I've written, there's also my [GitHub](https://github.com/bmroach).
